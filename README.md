FILL WITH INTRO STUFF WHEN YOU ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE DOING. 

This work is the result of an EPFL Master's Project by Peter Kaloyannis in colaboration with MIT PSFC. The project was supervised by Prof. Ambrogio Fasoli (EPFL), Dr. Cristina Rea (PSFC), and Dr. Alessandro Pau (EPFL) and is built off the work of Nadezda Yalynskaya of IAEA.
